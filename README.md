## 🌍 Why This Matters

**Hunger doesn't wait. Pain doesn't pause.**

Every day, millions of stray animals and wildlife suffer from starvation, abuse, and lack of medical care. They have no voice to ask for help, no bank accounts to save for emergencies, and no safety net.

**Open Donation** was born from a simple belief: **Technology can save lives.**

We are building a transparent, zero-overhead donation platform where **100% of funds** go directly to ground-level work—feeding drives, emergency surgeries, and vaccinations. 

By contributing code to this repository, you aren't just pushing pixels; you are helping build the digital infrastructure that delivers food to a hungry puppy or medicine to an injured bird.

**Your code commit = Real world impact.**

## 🚀 The Mission

1.  **Zero Overhead:** We aim to build a system where the platform takes $0 cuts.
2.  **Radical Transparency:** Future features will include open ledgers where every rupee/dollar is tracked from donor to recipient.
3.  **Speed:** A lightweight, fast interface that works on low-end devices, ensuring help is accessible to everyone.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

We believe in simplicity and performance. The current MVP is built with:

* **HTML5** - Semantic structure.
* **Tailwind CSS** - Rapid, utility-first styling for a modern aesthetic.
* **Alpine.js** - Lightweight JavaScript for interactivity (Carousel, Transitions) without the bloat of React/Vue.
* **Razorpay** - Secure, trusted payment gateway integration.
* **Lucide Icons** - Clean, lightweight SVG icons.

## ⚡ Quick Start

Want to help? Here is how to run the project locally:

1.  **Clone the repo**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OpenDonation/OpenDonation.github.io.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the directory**
    ```bash
    cd OpenDonation.github.io
    ```

3.  **Open the file**
    Simply open `index.html` in your browser. No build steps, no complex `npm install` required for the basic UI.
